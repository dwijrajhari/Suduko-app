# HelloWorld
My first repo !
This is a suduko-app which uses turtle module for animations and numpy for backend processing.
while using, make sure that the suduko_lev.py file is in the same directory as the main app file.

you can fine tune the animations to your liking by modyfing the variables in the app file.

To add a new level, create a (9, 9) numpy array and store it as lev_{level no.} in the levels file.
